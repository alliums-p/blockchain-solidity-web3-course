# Hardhat - Simple Storage

This project contains code on how to:

-   Use Hardhat to `deploy contracts`,
-   Use custom hardhat commands `(hardhat task)`,
-   Use `different networks` for deployment,
-   Use `etherscan api` to verify contract through code,
-   Use `gas reporter` to get gas consumption for deployment and contract functions,
-   Use `Chai` to test the contract,
-   Use `solidity coverage` to confirm test on all contract methods has been done,
